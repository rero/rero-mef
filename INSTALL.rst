Installation
============

You need to install `poetry`, it will handle the virtual environment creation for the project
in order to sandbox our Python environment, as well as manage the dependency installation,
among other things.

Start all dependent services using docker-compose (this will start PostgreSQL,
Elasticsearch 6, RabbitMQ and Redis):

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose up -d

.. note::

    Make sure you have `enough virtual memory
    <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode>`_
    for Elasticsearch in Docker:

    .. code-block:: shell

        # Linux
        $ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

        # macOS
        $ screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/com.docker.driver.amd64-linux/tty
        <enter>
        linut00001:~# sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144


Next, bootstrap the instance (this will install all Python dependencies and
build all static assets):

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run bootstrap

Next, create database tables, search indexes and message queues:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./scripts/setup

Running
-------
Start the webserver and the celery worker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./scripts/server

Start a Python shell:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./scripts/console

Upgrading
---------
In order to upgrade an existing instance simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./scripts/update

Testing
-------
Run the test suite via the provided script:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./run-tests.sh

By default, end-to-end tests are skipped. You can include the E2E tests like
this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ env E2E=yes ./run-tests.sh

For more information about end-to-end testing see `pytest-invenio
<https://pytest-invenio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#running-e2e-tests>`_

Documentation
-------------
You can build the documentation with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ poetry run build_sphinx

Production environment
----------------------
You can use simulate a full production environment using the
``docker-compose.full.yml``. You can start it like this:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker build --rm -t rero-mef-base:latest -f Dockerfile.base .
    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d

In addition to the normal ``docker-compose.yml``, this one will start:

- HAProxy (load balancer)
- Nginx (web frontend)
- UWSGI (application container)
- Celery (background task worker)
- Flower (Celery monitoring)
